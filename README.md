# viylouuInc-Launcher

![alt text](https://github.com/viylouu/viylouuInc-Launcher/blob/master/image.jpg?raw=true)

This is a launcher for all of the games i will be working on, the github page will contain the most up-to-date versions of the launcher
as well as including betas.

IF you want to compile this, you must use SimulationFramework and its counterparts, aswell as NAudio.

The game on itch.io will have the sound effects BUT it will not be up to date,
if i do add more sound effects that you do not have, you will either have to wait, or grab your own.

The game on itch.io will have ALL assets, so if you do compile this version yourself, you will need to put the Assets folder from the itch.io page
into the build files of the game.

The itch.io page is listed below
